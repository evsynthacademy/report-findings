## Discussion

You’re almost done! The discussion is the cherry on the top of your systematic review sundae. You’ve carefully described your research and your results; now you just have to explain what those results mean and why they matter. 

In other words, the purpose of your discussion is to explain the nature and importance of your findings. 

How? Just follow these seven steps:

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><b>1. Summarize</b><br>Summarize the study and the main results</li><br>
<li><b>2. Interpret</b><br>Interpret the results and suggest an explanation for them</li><br>
<li><b>3.Compare</b><br>Compare the results with what else is known about the problem (this might involve referencing earlier systematic reviews)</li><br>
<li><b>4. Generalize</b><br>Generalize the results to other populations or diseases if possible</li><br>
<li><b>4. Speculate</b><br>Speculate about the implications of your results on the health care delivery system</li><br>
<li><b>5. Critique</b><br>Critique your systematic review’s strengths and limitations. In particular:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Strength of evidence, were these studies at risk of bias or was the evidence observational or experimental?</li>
<li>Availability of evidence, did you need a larger sample of studies?</li>
<li>Potential reporting and publication bias</li>
<li>Presence of bias</li><br>You might think the limitations of your research are too obvious to mention. Or maybe you don’t want to draw attention to them. But there’s a greater harm in leaving out your limitations. If they’re missing, reviewers and readers will either assume you didn’t know about them, or worse, you’re trying to keep them secret.<br><br>When you’re open about these limitations, your reviewers and readers know you’re both knowledgeable and transparent.</ul></li>
<li><b><br>7. Itemize</b><br>Finally, to make sure you’re absolutely clear, list the conclusions of your research to make them more specific.<br>Here’s how CESH did that in its systematic review of management strategies for Renal Artery Stenosis:<br><br><ol>
<li>Overall, the evidence does not support a benefit with PTRAS over medical therapy alone in most patients with ARAS. </li>
<li>Observational studies, however, suggest that “high-risk” patients—specifically, those with worse kidney function, higher blood pressure, or flash pulmonary edema—may be more likely to have improved kidney function and blood pressure with PTRAS.</li>
