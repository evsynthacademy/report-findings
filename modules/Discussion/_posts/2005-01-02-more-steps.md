## More Steps


<b>Critique</b><br>
Critique your systematic review’s strengths and limitations. In particular:<br>
<ul>
<li>Strength of evidence, were these studies at risk of bias or was the evidence observational or experimental?</li>
<li>Availability of evidence, did you need a larger sample of studies?</li>
<li>Potential reporting and publication bias</li>
<li>Presence of bias</li></ul>You might think the limitations of your research are too obvious to mention. Or maybe you don’t want to draw attention to them. But there’s a greater harm in leaving out your limitations. If they’re missing, reviewers and readers will either assume you didn’t know about them, or worse, you’re trying to keep them secret.<br><br>When you’re open about these limitations, your reviewers and readers know you’re both knowledgeable and transparent.<br>
<b><br>Itemize</b><br>Finally, to make sure you’re absolutely clear, list the conclusions of your research to make them more specific.<br><br>
Here’s how CESH did that in its systematic review of management strategies for Renal Artery Stenosis:<br>
<ol>
<li>Overall, the evidence does not support a benefit with PTRAS over medical therapy alone in most patients with ARAS. </li>
<li>Observational studies, however, suggest that “high-risk” patients—specifically, those with worse kidney function, higher blood pressure, or flash pulmonary edema—may be more likely to have improved kidney function and blood pressure with PTRAS.</li></ol>
