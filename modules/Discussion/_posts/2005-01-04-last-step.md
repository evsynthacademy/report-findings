At the end of the your article, you need to include a few last details:

<ol>
<li>Prepare your bibliography (be sure to double and triple check your citations to make sure they’re correct).</li>
<li>Create your appendix which will include items such as:<br>
<ul>
<li>A list of studies that weren’t included in your research with an explanation about why you excluded them.</li>
<li>More details about the characteristics of studies you included</li>
<li>Sensitivity analysis </li>
<li>More details about your methods</li></ul></li>
<li>Include this information about your authors:<br>
<ul>
<li>Academic or industry affiliations</li>
<li>Conflicts of interest</li>
<li>Funding sources</li></ul></li>
</ol>

And, write your acknowledgements. This is the place to mention people who helped with the research but aren’t listed as authors.
