##  Problem Statement

<center>What problem motivated this research?</center>
<br>
<i>In 2007, a systematic review of management strategies for ARAS found no evidence that one ARAS treatment approach was better than another. But since then, researchers have conducted two large scale trials that call into question the value of using PTRAS to treat ARAS.<br><br>In light of this new research, itâ€™s important to revisit the entire body of evidence to examine the comparative harms and benefits of all ARAS management approaches.</i>
