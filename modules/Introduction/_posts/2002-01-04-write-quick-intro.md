##  Developing your search terms

Now that you’ve identified the best sources for your research, it’s time to start searching! But what words should you use in your search? <br><br><br><br>

This is actually trickier than it sounds. You have to walk the fine line of gathering every possible relevant article without pulling in too many papers that have nothing to do with your question. You also have to consider the various words different researchers might use to describe the same topic. <br><br>

You can find plenty of online resources that go into great depth about how to develop your search terms, but here are a few quick tips and best practices to get you started:<br><br>

1. **Identify synonyms**<br>To identify more search terms, go back to the PICO(D) elements of your question and list all the synonyms you can think of for your population, intervention, and comparators of interest.  For help, you can consult with experts in the field, librarians, and even a thesaurus.<br><br>
2. **Look for related search strategies**<br>One good way to find relevant terms is to identify one or two systematic reviews on your topic or a similar topic. Ideally, the researchers will have a published description of their search strategy, which can be a starting point for your own search.  <br><br>
Keep in mind that your research question probably won’t match theirs exactly, so you will have to remove keywords that aren’t relevant and add additional terms that weren’t included. You might also borrow elements of a few search strategies and combine them together.  For example, one systematic review may give you population terms, but another may be better for intervention terms.<br><br>
3. **Search for MeSH terms**<br>Finally, for every concept term (e.g. heart attack) in your research questions, you’ll want to find terms in the controlled vocabulary of your chosen database. For MEDLINE, you will use the Medical Subheadings (MeSH) database to find “indexed terms.”  The MeSH database is the National Library of Medicine’s resource for medical vocabulary. It catalogs and describes the hierarchy of terminology used to describe biomedical information in MEDLINE. When you type your concept terms into MeSH, you’ll find a list of other medical synonyms and suggestions on how to search for these terms using PubMed.<br><br>
It’s important to look for index terms because basic search terms only apply to words found in the database record for the paper, not the full text.  A given term may not necessarily be in the title or abstract, but would be covered by the headings assigned to papers by a human indexer.  To help identify useful MeSH terms, you can find a record for a paper you know you plan to include in your review and look at the assigned MeSH terms to find ones that might be relevant. <br><br>In addition, an indexed term may encompass multiple entry terms. For example, the concept for “heart attack” is indexed as myocardial infarction in MeSH. If you just search for “heart attack” you run the risk of missing papers that use the term myocardial infarction. For indexed papers, using the index terms captures papers that use “heart attack” as well as those that use “myocardial infarction.”<br><br>
MeSH terms describe how medical terminology is used in PubMed. If you are working in Embase, these terms are called “Emtree.” Likewise, CINAHL has its own specific vocabulary. Even though the names of these indexes are different, the way you use them is the same.

Once you’ve identified all of the words related to your research question, it’s time to string them together into sentences that form your search. We do that using something called boolean logic.
