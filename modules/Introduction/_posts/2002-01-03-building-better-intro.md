##  Gray Literature

It would be a mistake to think that academic journals are your only source for information. If your questions are about a topic that is understudied or rapidly changing, you’ll want to be sure to look for evidence outside of the traditional databases. In other words, you’ll want to search for **gray literature**. <br><br>
**Gray literature** describes documents that were published by non-commercial sources, such as think tanks, non-profits, and government entities. It can offer the most up to date information about your topic or fill in the gaps for a question that’s not fully addressed in the academic literature.  <br><br>
Gray literature also includes **unpublished research** such as clinical trials registries, dissertations, papers presented at conferences, and research that never made it into a journal.  <br><br>
Finding gray literature is tricky. There’s no comprehensive, systematic way to find dissertations, think tanks, or conferences that might address your question. This is where your librarian will be a huge help. You’ll also want to talk with your subject matter experts and stakeholders about key sources of gray literature.
