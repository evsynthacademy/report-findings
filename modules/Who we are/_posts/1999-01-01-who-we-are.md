## Who We Are: The Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health

<br>


When policy makers and health care practitioners seek to make informed decisions, they face a rapidly expanding supply of evidence. In 2010, there were 75 randomized trials being published every day and the pace of published research continues to climb every year.  This is good news, in many ways, but it challenges decision-makers to sift through a vast volume of evidence, the quality of which can be quite variable, to ascertain the state of our knowledge about a particular intervention or policy. 
 
At the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health (formerly known as the "Center for Evidence-based Medicine"), we use research and analytic tools to transform vast quantities of evidence into essential knowledge. Our work helps policy experts and clinicians make informed and rational decisions.
