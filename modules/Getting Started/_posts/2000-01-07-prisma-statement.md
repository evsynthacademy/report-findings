## Read the PRISMA Statement

In 2005, a group of systematic review experts developed a revised set of standards for reporting systematic reviews.

PRISMA contains a 27 item checklist and a flow diagram, all created to improve the way researchers report systematic reviews and meta-analysis. You can read the PRISMA statement here.
