## How to Begin

This course will walk you through each element of a standard, publishable report, pointing out common mistakes and tips for organizing your writing. But before we dive into the details, let’s discuss some guiding principles:


**1. Follow instructions**<br>
Do you know the number one reason academic journals reject submissions for publication? The authors didn’t follow instructions. Every journal has a set of “instructions for authors” detailing everything from reference formatting to how to number your tables and charts. Here’s an example from JAMA. Be sure to find these instructions and follow them as you structure your report. And of course, if you are rejected by one journal and submit to another journal, be sure to reformat your paper to reflect the new instructions.

**2. Establish authorship in advance**<br>
Who counts as an author of your report? It’s best to establish your official authors BEFORE you start writing. The true purpose of authorship is to assign credit and responsibility. You should only list people as authors if they actually contributed to the research and the writing of the report. If you agree on who is and is not an author in advance, you can avoid an awkward conversation later on in the process.

**3. Think visually**<br>
A successful report relies on clear visuals as well as clear language. If you have access to a graphics department, ask for help designing your tables and charts so they can be as instructive as possible. If you can’t get graphic design help, be sure to think carefully about how you display your information. Don’t simply cut and paste the images that you used to analyze your data. Think about how the information could be organized for readers who didn’t conduct the research.  

**4. Protect your credibility: check your work!**<br>
Whether it feels fair or not, readers will judge you and your academic abilities based on the quality of your report. Your main objective is to prove that your research and conclusions can be trusted. In this case, details really matter. A references list littered with errors or a table with data that doesn’t match the text makes your work look sloppy and unreliable. So be sure to give yourself enough time to take a second look at every last detail before you submit your report for publication.  

**5. Read the PRISMA statement**<br>
In 2005, a group of systematic review experts developed a revised set of standards for reporting systematic reviews. Four years later, they published PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses). PRISMA contains a 27 item checklist and a flow diagram, all created to improve the way researchers report systematic reviews and meta-analysis. You can read the PRISMA statement here. 

One more thing to keep in mind: journal editors say the ideal scientific article contains new information, is valid, important, and clearly defined. Let these be your guiding principles as you’re pulling together your report. 

Now, let’s dig into the elements of your article, starting with the title.
