## Think Visually

A successful report relies on clear visuals as well as clear language. If you have access to a graphics department, ask for help designing your tables and charts so they can be as instructive as possible. If you can’t get graphic design help, be sure to think carefully about how you display your information. Don’t simply cut and paste the images that you used to analyze your data. Think about how the information could be organized for readers who didn’t conduct the research.
