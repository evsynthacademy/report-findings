## Getting Started


At this point in your systematic review, you’ve waded through stacks of possible evidence, screened and extracted the most relevant literature, and analyzed your data. By now, you should know how the existing evidence answers (or doesn't answer) your research questions. 

You’re almost done! You just have to report your findings. 

Writing down the steps you took and what you discovered might sound easy, but recording all of this information isn’t enough. You need to carefully construct your report so it’s understandable and more importantly, publishable. Because if no one publishes your research, no one will know it happened. 

In addition to the information given below, you might also watch the lecture by Tom Lang, a senior medical writer and author of <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Write-Publish-Present-Health-Sciences/dp/1934465143">How to Report Statistics in Medicine</a>, which he gave at the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health in November of 2015.
