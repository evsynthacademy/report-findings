## Establish Authorship in Advance

Who counts as an author of your report? Itâ€™s best to establish your official authors BEFORE you start writing. The true purpose of authorship is to assign credit and responsibility. You should only list people as authors if they actually contributed to the research and the writing of the report. If you agree on who is and is not an author in advance, you can avoid an awkward conversation later on in the process.
