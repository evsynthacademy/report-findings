## Introduce a Result, Not a Figure or Table

When you’re writing the results section, it’s your job to highlight and describe the most important aspects of your findings. But often, authors merely introduce a set of data and expect readers to interpret it for themselves. 

How often have you seen a researcher write something like this:

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>Table 2 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample.</i></li></ul>

This sentence says nothing about the results of your research. It just introduces the title of table 2. In some cases, you could start a paragraph with this sentence to introduce a table, but you can’t stop there. Follow up by summarizing the important results in the table. Then, refer to the table that contains that data. For example:

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>Almost 90% of patients were smokers; two-thirds of tumors were in the glottic larynx and one-third in the supraglottic larynx (Table 2).</i></li></ul>
