## Use Descriptive Figure Captions

Take a look at this picture:
<br>
<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/fish.png">
</center>

Is it a picture of:

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>A. A Fish</li>
<li>B. A Fish</li>
<li>C. A Fish</li>
</ul>


If you guessed fish, you’re right!  Did you need a figure caption to tell you it was a fish? I don’t think so. That’s why a figure caption like this one isn’t very helpful:
<br>
<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/homer.png"><br>
<b>An x-ray of a cartoon character's brain.</b>
</center>
<br>
This caption just tells you what you can already see- this is an x-ray of a cartoon character. It doesn’t offer any new information. When you’re writing your figure captions, try to add useful descriptions. Here’s another try at describing the same figure:
<br>
<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/homer.png"><br>
<b>A 27-year-old male cartoon character with microcephaly.</b>
</center>
