## Results

Your results section should accomplish two main goals:

<ul>
<li>Describe what happened during the process of conducting your research
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>For example, how many articles did you find when you searched for studies? How many remained after the screening process?</li></ul>
  <li>Present your findings, but don’t interpret them. That goes in the discussion.</li></ul>

The results section is probably the most data heavy portion of your study. This is where you’ll present charts and tables of what happened during your research. 

On the next page, we’ll offer some tips about the best ways to present these numbers.
