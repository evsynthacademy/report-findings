## Supplemental Materials


Thanks to the internet, you have lots of opportunities to share more information about your research. Journals now have online appendices where you can include additional information. Itâ€™s good practice to prepare supplemental materials such as additional data and detailed descriptions of your study protocol and literature search strategy. Many journals also want you to publish your data and any code you used to make your calculations.
