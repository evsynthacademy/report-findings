## The Forest Plot


All systematic reviews should include a forest plot. It’s designed to visualize the differences between studies. The examples below are adapted from real data, but the study titles have been changed.

A forest plot basically maps out the results of each individual study (expressed as an odds ratio), showing the confidence interval for those results. All forest plots include “a line of no effect.” If any confidence intervals cross this line, then the results are inconclusive.

If you conducted meta-analysis, your forest plot will include additional information, including a “summary” odds ratio at the bottom of the plot calculated as a weighted average of the odds ratios of each study.

To learn more about forest plots and how to read them, watch this video.

In our Meta-Analysis course, we go into more detail about the various analytic techniques you can use to combine and display your findings.

Those include Subgroup analysis, which is a forest plot broken into categories.

And meta-regression, which uses continuous variables to explore their effect on the outcome.<br>
