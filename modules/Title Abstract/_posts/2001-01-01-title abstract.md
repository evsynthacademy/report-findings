## Title

You might think your title is just the name of your article, but it’s more than that. It’s actually the most important element of your report. Why? Because it helps your reader decide if he or she should read the full article. Your title also helps interested readers find your research. 

That’s why it’s important to write a title that is clear and specific. 

A good title must:
<br>

- **Stand alone** <br>You shouldn’t need the abstract or any other part of the report to understand the title. Also, no abbreviations!<br>

- **Put important nouns first** <br>Don’t bury the key information! Put your intervention, comparators and outcomes near the front of the title and the design of your research near the end.<br>
- **Be concise** <br>Most journals limit how many words you can use in your title, so write succinctly!<br><br>

**Title format**
There are a few different types of journal titles, but because you’re conducting a systematic review, it’s likely you’ll write what’s called an “informative title.” Informative titles don’t ask a question or state research results. They simply describe the relationship you examined in your research. 

Here’s an example of an informative title:

<h2><i>Comparative Effectiveness of Management Strategies for Renal Artery Stenosis: An Updated Systematic Review</i></h2>

So what should you include in your title? It all goes back to PICO (D).
