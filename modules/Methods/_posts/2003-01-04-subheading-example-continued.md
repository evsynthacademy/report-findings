## Example Continued

**Study Selection**

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>We included studies of adults treated for ARAS that reported long-term (≥6 months) outcomes or adverse events. The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality; kidney function, blood pressure control, cardiovascular disease, including congestive heart failure; and adverse events… We  included randomized, controlled trials and nonrandomized, comparative studies comparing PTRAS versus any medical therapy with at least 10 participants per group....</i></li></ul>

**Data Extraction**

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>Data from each study were extracted by 1 of 6 experienced methodologists and confirmed by at least 1 other. Extracted data included study, participant, and ARAS characteristics; interventions; outcomes; and study design...<br> 
<br>
Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias at the study level, with notation of specific outcomes at increased risk of bias... Two reviewers independently categorized the strength of evidence across studies as high, moderate, or low for each outcome category...</i></li></ul>

**Data Synthesis/Statistical Methods** - including statistical model and software programs used

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>Meta-analysis was not conducted because of significant clinical heterogeneity. Between-group comparisons are summarized by effect size (expressed as either a hazard ratio [HR] or an odds ratio) and were synthesized qualitatively.</i></li></ul>
