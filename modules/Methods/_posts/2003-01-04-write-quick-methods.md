## Abstract

Your abstract is similar to your title. Readers will use it to decide whether they should read the full article. 

Your abstract should also stand alone, but that doesn't mean it needs to include every element of your study. Because of word limits, you wonâ€™t have enough space to prove the validity of your research, just enough to explain the basics of what you set out to do, what you did, and what you discovered.
