## Method Subheading Examples

How do you fill in the text for those method subheadings? Here are some abbreviated examples from the systematic review about Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis (ARAS):

**Study Objectives**

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>Reevaluate the comparative benefits and harms of strategies for management
of patients with ARAS and to identify factors that may predict which patients are most likely to benefit from each intervention.</i></li></ul>

**Data Sources** - including the dates when search was conducted

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 2007 through 16 March 2016 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database
of Systematic Reviews through the fourth quarter of 2015...</i></li></ul>

**Search Criteria**

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>The electronic search strategy combined terms for renal artery stenosis, renal hypertension, and renal vascular disease and was limited to adult humans, relevant research designs, and the English language...</i></li></ul>

**Study Selection**

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>We included studies of adults treated for ARAS that reported long-term (≥6 months) outcomes or adverse events. The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality; kidney function, blood pressure control, cardiovascular disease, including congestive heart failure; and adverse events… We  included randomized, controlled trials and nonrandomized, comparative studies comparing PTRAS versus any medical therapy with at least 10 participants per group....</i></li></ul>

**Data Extraction**

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>Data from each study were extracted by 1 of 6 experienced methodologists and confirmed by at least 1 other. Extracted data included study, participant, and ARAS characteristics; interventions; outcomes; and study design... 
<br>
Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias at the study level, with notation of specific outcomes at increased risk of bias... Two reviewers independently categorized the strength of evidence across studies as high, moderate, or low for each outcome category...</i></li></ul>

**Data Synthesis/Statistical Methods** - including statistical model and software programs used

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><i>Meta-analysis was not conducted because of significant clinical heterogeneity. Between-group comparisons are summarized by effect size (expressed as either a hazard ratio [HR] or an odds ratio) and were synthesized qualitatively.</i></li></ul>
