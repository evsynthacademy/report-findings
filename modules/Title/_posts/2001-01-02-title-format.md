## Title Format

There are a few different types of journal titles, but because you’re conducting a systematic review, it’s likely you’ll write what’s called an “informative title.” Informative titles don’t ask a question or state research results. They simply describe the relationship you examined in your research. 

Here’s an example of an informative title:

<h4><i>Comparative Effectiveness of Management Strategies for Renal Artery Stenosis: An Updated Systematic Review</i></h4>

So what should you include in your title? It all goes back to PICO (D).
