## Title

You might think your title is just the name of your article, but it’s more than that. It’s actually the most important element of your report. Why? Because it helps your reader decide if he or she should read the full article. Your title also helps readers find your research when they’re searching the literature. 

That’s why it’s important to write a title that is clear and specific. 

A good title must:
<br>

- **Stand alone** <br>You shouldn’t need the abstract or any other part of the report to understand the title. Also, no abbreviations!<br>

- **Put important nouns first** <br>Don’t bury the key information! Put your intervention, comparators and outcomes near the front of the title and the design of your research near the end.<br>
- **Be concise** <br>Most journals limit how many words you can use in your title, so write succinctly!<br><br>
