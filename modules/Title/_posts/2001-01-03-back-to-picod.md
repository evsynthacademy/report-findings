## Back to PICO(D)

A good journal title is similar to a good research question; both use the elements of PICO(D).  If youâ€™ve forgotten, PICO(D) stands for:

- **Population:** What specific people or conditions are you researching?<br>

- **Interventions:** What treatments, diagnostic tests, or other interventions or exposures are you studying?<br>

- **Comparators:** What are you comparing this intervention or exposure to?<br>

- **Outcomes:** What measures or events are you using to evaluate the intervention?<br>

- The **(D)** stands for **Design:** What types of studies should be included to evaluate the interventions and outcomes?<br>

Try to fit all of the elements of PICO(D) into your title. These details will make it easier for readers to know if they should bother to read the rest of your article.
