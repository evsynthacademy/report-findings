## Back to PICO(D)

A good journal title is similar to a good research question; both use the elements of PICO(D).  If youâ€™ve forgotten, PICO(D) stands for:

- **Population:** What specific people or conditions are you researching?<br>

- **Interventions:** What treatments, diagnostic tests, or other interventions or exposures are you studying?<br>

- **Comparators:** What are you comparing this intervention or exposure to?<br>

- **Outcomes:** What measures or events are you using to evaluate the intervention?<br>

- The **(D)** stands for **Design:** What types of studies should be included to evaluate the interventions and outcomes?<br>

Try to fit all of the elements of PICO(D) into your title. These details will make it easier for readers to know if they should bother to read the rest of your article. 

For example, this title is ok:

- <i>Low-Air Loss Beds for Treating Pressure Ulcers: A Systematic Review</i><br>

But it only includes the intervention (low-air loss beds), the outcomes (pressure ulcers) and the design (systematic review).

This title is better:

- <i>Low-Air Loss Beds vs Foam Mattresses for Treating Pressure Ulcers  in Nursing Home Patients: A Systematic Review</i><br>

Notice that this title includes both the intervention <u>and</u> the comparator (foam mattresses). It also adds in the population (nursing home patients). 

Of course, if you have character limits for your title, you might have to remove some of the elements of PICO(D). Do that by removing the least important elements first. In this case, you might start by removing the population (nursing home patients).
