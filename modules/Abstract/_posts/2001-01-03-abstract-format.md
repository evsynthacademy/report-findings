## Abstract Format

Each journal has slightly different requirements for the abstract. As always, be sure to read the author instructions before you do too much work. However, abstracts for systematic reviews typically follow the format of what’s known as a “structured” abstract.

**Structured abstracts**

Structured abstracts summarize each part of the article under a separate heading. Here are typical headings to include:

- Background<br>
- Purpose<br>
- Data sources<br>
- Study selection/selection criteria<br>
- Data extraction<br>
- Data synthesis<br>
- Limitation<br>
- Conclusion<br>
