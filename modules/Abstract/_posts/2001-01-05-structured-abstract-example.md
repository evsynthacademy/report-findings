## Structured Abstract Example


Here is the structured abstract for a systematic review that compared treatment strategies for renal artery stenosis (<a href = "http://evsynthacademy.org/Intro-Evidence-Synthesis/modules/using%20systematic%20reviews/ras/">you might remember this topic from our intro course</a>). 

<center><h5><b>Comparative Effectiveness of Management Strategies for Renal Artery Stenosis: An Updated Systematic Review</b></h5></center>


- **Background:**<br>
Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis (ARAS) is associated with high blood pressure (BP), decreased kidney function, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT), and death.

- **Purpose:**<br>
To compare benefits and harms of Percutaneous Transluminal Renal Angioplasty with Stent Placement (PTRAS) versus medical therapy alone in adults with ARAS.

- **Data Sources:**<br>
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1993 to 16 March 2016; gray literature; and prior systematic reviews.

- **Study Selection:**<br>
Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); nonrandomized, comparative studies (NRCSs); single-group studies; and selected case reports that reported all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, RRT, kidney function, BP, and adverse events.

- **Data Extraction:**<br>
Six researchers extracted data on design, interventions, outcomes, and study quality into a web-based database.
